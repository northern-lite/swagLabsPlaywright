### Project to demonstrate the capabilities of Playwright
Per the creators, Playwright is a framework for Web Testing and Automation. It allows testing Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast.
I use this tool in my work on a daily basis and wanted to create a public demonstration of its capabilities, starting with the [Swag Labs](https://www.saucedemo.com/).
